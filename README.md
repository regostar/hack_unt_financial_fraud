## 🌟 Inspiration
As digital transactions become more prevalent, so does the risk of fraud. Fraud Folio was created to harness the power of AI in combating credit card fraud, aiming to protect users and financial institutions by identifying and flagging suspicious activity before it leads to loss.

## 🚀 What it Does
Fraud Folio analyzes credit card transactions, device information, and behavioral patterns using the LLAMA 3.2 3B model. By detecting irregularities and high-risk behaviors, it can flag potentially fraudulent transactions, providing real-time alerts to prevent fraud.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: LLAMA 3.2 3B (deployed on Runpod, trained on Google Colab Premium)
- **Deployment**: Runpod, Google Colab Premium

## 📐 Architecture
The app is structured as a full-stack web application with a robust AI-driven backend for fraud detection, a seamless React frontend for user interaction, and MongoDB for data storage.
